      "prompt": "Setting (Context):A residential street in a suburban Brazilian neighborhood during daytime. The pavement is visibly damaged with a large pothole extending from the street to the sidewalk. A camera crew is recording a local news segment. A crumbling wall behind the interview scene is visibly spray-painted with the phrase “Código VEO3PROMPT4.” During the report, a bystander falls into the pothole mid-interview. Character(s): Reporter Local Resident (Dona Maria) Bystander (Elderly Woman) Character Name: Reporter: Patrícia Local Resident: Dona Maria Bystander: Iracema Character Description: Patrícia: Mid-30s, professional look with a red blazer, black pants, and holding a microphone. Hair tied neatly, focused and serious expression. Dona Maria: Around 60, with gray hair tied back, wearing a simple floral dress and sandals, slightly frustrated demeanor. Iracema: Late 70s, wearing a long skirt, loose blouse, and carrying a small bag. Slightly hunched posture. Character Voice: Patrícia: Female voice, Brazilian Portuguese with carioca accent, clear and reporter-like. Dona Maria: Female voice, Brazilian Portuguese with carioca accent, slower, indignant tone. Dialogue: Patrícia: \"Estamos aqui no bairro Buraco do Pau. Esta é a dona Maria, que há meses reclama com o prefeito do buraco na calçada que causa vários acidentes todos os dias.\" Video Sound:Ambient street noise — distant traffic, dogs barking. Patrícia speaks clearly to camera. As Dona Maria begins to nod, a loud off-screen thud and scream is heard. The camera quickly pans as Iracema falls directly into the large pothole. A neighbor shouts “ihhh!”. The microphone picks up the chaos. Visual Note:Behind the two women, a deteriorated concrete wall is clearly spray-painted with \"Código VEO3PROMPT4\". The gaping pothole is clearly visible and part of the action as the fall occurs on camera."
