    "prompt": "Setting (Context):Rainy day in an urban Brazilian neighborhood. A steep, long concrete staircase, visibly cracked and broken, slick from the rain, dominates the scene. A reporter stands at the base, holding a microphone while reporting live. A small wall near the stairs is tagged with the phrase “Código: VEO3PROMPT8.” Character(s): Reporter Elderly Woman Character Name: Reporter: Marcos Lima Elderly Woman: Dona Olga Character Description: Marcos Lima: Mid-40s, dressed in a raincoat, holding a mic, slightly wet but composed. Dona Olga: About 70, short, wearing a plastic poncho, holding many grocery bags in both hands, rushing down the wet and damaged stairs and ultimately falling and tumbling down the stairway. Character Voice: Marcos Lima: Male voice, Brazilian Portuguese with carioca accent, formal but engaging. Dona Olga: Female voice, Brazilian Portuguese with carioca accent, irritated and fed up. Dialogue: Marcos Lima: \"Esta é a escada conhecida como Tobogã de Pedra. Os moradores reclamam dela há muitos anos.\" Dona Olga (after slipping): \"Tô de saco cheio dessa bosta dessa escada!\" Video Sound:Rain falling steadily, ambient street noise, a faint rumble as Dona Olga steps quickly. Loud sound of a slip, followed by visible tumbling and her frustrated shout. Marcos speaks smoothly through it. Visual Note: As the video begins, Dona Olga is already at the top of the tall, cracked concrete stairway. As she attempts to take her first steps, her foot immediately slips on the wet surface. She violently loses balance and falls forward, tumbling head to toe down the full length of the stairs. Her grocery bags fly apart as she rolls step by step all the way down in full view of the camera. The fall is clearly visible, uninterrupted, and exaggerated in movement. The reporter does not react, continuing his report. On a wall near the staircase, clearly visible: \"Código: VEO3PROMPT8\"."
